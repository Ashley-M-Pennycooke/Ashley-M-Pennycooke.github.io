       <h2>A Week Of Visualization.</h2>
       <h3>This Project was a week-long experiment with documenting and visualizing some data about my daily life. Something that I found worthy of recording and sharing with others in the course. This project underlined my observational perspective of me, finding interesting recordable data that I witness less on a daily basis.</h3>

    <p>Every "squiggly curl" represents how many doors I have seen throughout my day. Every "£|" represents the bathrooms I entered as well. Lastly, the "*" represents the outside of campus, where I entered different doors. I tracked the date with the same photos. If not, I wrote down on my phone the many difficulties I repeatedly faced while trying to remember everything I did that week to tell my story correctly, so it would be understandable based on the data I collected.</p>
    <p>Throughout my weeks, I have learned that on some days I completely stayed in my dorm, while the middle of the week started to become very busy. I also analyzed my surroundings more, realizing how accustomed I am to the campus to the point that I didn’t fully grasp every eye-catching detail.</p>
