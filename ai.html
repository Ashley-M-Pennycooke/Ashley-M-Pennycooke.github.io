 <h1> Rebuilding Elizabot</h1>

     <h2>Context</h2>
     <p>I’ve transformed my Elizabot into a comedic therapist named Amber a chatbot with heart, humor, and just enough sass to keep things interesting. Amber isn’t your average robotic responder stuck in an existential crisis loop of “Why do you say that?” or “Tell me more about that.” Instead, she’s designed to feel like that funny, emotionally in-tune friend who’s always ready to chat, hype you up, or crack a joke when things feel heavy. I reworked many of the standard responses from dry or clinical to warm, quirky, and fun.
     <p>For instance, instead of saying something like "Do you believe that?" Amber might say, “Me? Forget? I’m basically 98% memory… and 2% sass.” The idea is that she can still serve as a reflective conversationalist (like classic Eliza), but with the twist of making you smile along the way. Whether you’re feeling confused, excited, or just want to vent about your favorite pizza topping Amber's got you. The inspiration behind this update came from childhood shows like Lab Rats, where the house AI “Eddy” had a vibrant personality and sharp wit.
     <p>That blend of digital intelligence and human-like warmth made conversations fun and memorable. I wanted Amber to have that same feel capable of being a friend who listens and makes you laugh without ever sounding too scripted. Ultimately, I wanted to create a space where conversations feel comfortable and ridiculous at the same time.
