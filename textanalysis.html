 <h1> Text Analysis</h1>
 <h2> Reading Early internet texts through text encoding and Voyant</h2>
 <p>In my analysis of various poems, I've used the encoding method along with a tool called Voyant to visualize the texts. This approach gave me a well-rounded understanding of the poems, showing how language, themes, and reader interaction work together. By carefully marking the texts and using visual tools, I discovered deeper meanings in the language and imagery, explored the themes presented, and felt the emotional reactions these poems inspire.</p>
 <p>One of the main insights from the encoding process was how language affects our emotions. While examining the poems, I looked for old-fashioned and poetic language, moments full of movement or tension, and instances where the meaning was unclear. For example, I marked a line like:</p>
<code>&lt;define> methought &lt;</define>, his voice did swim
<line>As if it drowned in remembrance were
<line>Of thoughts which make the moist eyes overbrim:&lt;/line></code>
<p>This line showcases poetic language that might be difficult for today’s readers to understand, yet it evokes strong feelings related to memory and loss. Engaging with such lines required careful reading, allowing me to uncover multiple layers of meaning that better my understanding of the characters’ experiences.</p>
<p>I also found that Voyant’s visual features, like the word cloud and Terms Berry visualization, highlighted how often the word "like" appeared in the poems. This frequency indicates a tendency for simile and comparison in poetic language, which adds emotional weight and creates vivid imagery that connects with readers personally.</p>
 <p>During my analysis, I noticed that contradictions often emerged as a key theme. Through encoding, I found phrases that express conflicting emotions and moral dilemmas, such as:</p>
<code>&lt;line>&lt;note>We all are brethren--even the slaves who kill</line>
<line>Even as to thee have these done ill, and are forgiven!</line>
<line>For hire, are men;&lt;/note> and to avenge misdeed &lt;/line></code>
<p>These contradictions prompt readers to wrestle with complex questions about justice and what it means to be human. The poems don’t neatly categorize characters as heroes or villains; instead, they encourage readers to engage empathetically. This theme of complexity was highlighted by Voyant, which showed the frequency of words related to morality, reinforcing these intricate ideas throughout the narratives.</p>
<p>nother focus of my markup process was on lines that depict movement and tension. I identified selections such as</p>
<code>&lt;p><line>Over the utmost hill at length I sped,</line>
 <line>A snowy steep:--the moon was hanging low &lt;/line></code>
 <p>These lines convey a sense of urgency and change, reflecting the protagonist’s journey from isolation to enlightenment. This vivid imagery links physical movement with the character’s internal awakening, revealing the story's deep themes. Voyant supported this idea further by clustering related terms that described both physical actions and emotional states, connecting the character's experiences to broader themes. The instances of movement act as more than just physical events; they serve as metaphors for personal growth and transformation. The encoding process revealed how moments of reflection mixed with action create a dialogue between the character’s external experiences and internal conflicts. This duality emphasizes significant tensions within the narrative, allowing readers to join the protagonist in exploring existential questions.</p>
 <p>The imagery found in the poems serves as an important tool that supports key themes. By marking occurrences where light and dark, celestial and earthly images were paired together, I saw how these visuals directly related to the changes in the protagonist. For example, moments of clear contrast in imagery provide a backdrop for personal growth and internal enlightenment. Using the Voyant tool enabled me to visualize these thematic links through the relationship between word frequency and context. The presence of certain visual elements like images related to nature and celestial bodies emphasized the protagonist’s journey towards enlightenment, contributing significantly to the overall structure of the narrative. While analyzing these connections, I realized that the relationship between language and imagery greatly influences how readers emotionally respond to the poems. The details I captured during the encoding process, combined with Voyant's visualizations, paint a easy picture of poetic meaning.</p>
 <p>Through my analysis, I began to understand how important reader engagement is with the emotional themes of the poems. The emotional landscape allows readers to connect deeply with the text. The combination of rich language, imagery, and thematic complexity explores feelings like loss, regret, and hope, evoking profound responses. My use of encoding helped to highlight emotions threaded throughout the poems. As I engaged with different poems, I marked phrases that demonstrated this emotional spectrum. A line such as:</p>
 <coding>&lt;p><line>Men said, into a smile which &lt;define> guile &lt;/define> portended,</line>
 <line>A sight with which that child like hope with fear was blended.</p></line></coding>
<p>This markup captures the essence of hope intertwined with fragility, evoking a gentle yet powerful feeling that resonates deeply. By tracking such lines, I gained insight into the use of emotion as a bridge between the text and the reader, facilitating engagement and reflection.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with analyzing poetic texts using encoding and Voyant tools has shown me how language, themes, and emotions are deeply connected. I’ve learned that language can evoke strong emotional responses, and that complex themes can lead to interesting conflicts. Movement within the poems often acts as a metaphor for change. The vivid imagery and strong structure help us understand the protagonist's journey and its connection to larger themes about life. This comprehensive way of looking at poetry enhances reader engagement and insight, making the exploration of these texts more rewarding. Through this process, I have gained a deeper appreciation for the subtlety of poetic expression and the emotional bonds it creates with readers.</p>
