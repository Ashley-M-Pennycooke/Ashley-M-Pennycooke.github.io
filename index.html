    <h4>Digital Projects</h4>
    <p> Every "squiggly curl" represents how many doors I have seen throughout my day. Every "£|" represents the bathrooms I entered as well. Lastly, the "*" represents the outside of campus, where I entered different doors. I tracked the date with the same photos. If not, I wrote down on my phone the many difficulties I repeatedly faced while trying to remember everything I did that week to tell my story correctly, so it would be understandable based on the data I collected. Throughout my weeks, I have learned that on some days I completely stayed in my dorm, while the middle of the week started to become very busy. I also analyzed my surroundings more, realizing how accustomed I am to the campus to the point that I didn’t fully grasp every eye-catching detail.</p>

    <h4> Hobbies </h4>
    <p> I have a deep passion for hand-drawing a variety of subjects, from expressive eyes to intricate portraits of people, and the stunning beauty of nature. Traveling is also an important part of my life, primarily to places that hold personal significance, such as Barbados, Florida, Canada, and Haiti. I enjoy capturing moments through photography, whether it's breathtaking landscapes, delicious culinary creations, or playful selfies with my family and friends. Each of these hobbies allows me to express my creativity and cherish meaningful experiences.</p>
