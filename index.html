    <h3> Hobbies </h3>
    <p> I have a deep passion for hand-drawing a variety of subjects, from expressive eyes to intricate portraits of people, and the stunning beauty of nature. Traveling is also an important part of my life, primarily to places that hold personal significance, such as Barbados, Florida, Canada, and Haiti. I enjoy capturing moments through photography, whether it's breathtaking landscapes, delicious culinary creations, or playful selfies with my family and friends. Each of these hobbies allows me to express my creativity and cherish meaningful experiences.</p>
