     <h2>Context</h2>
   <p>"Echoes of the Attic" is a Twine-based serious game designed to immerse players in a mystery rooted in familial trauma, political legacy, and personal truth. I chose this topic to explore the concept of historical silencing—how some voices are erased and the ethical dilemma of revealing or protecting such truths.
The game follows a protagonist exploring their late grandmother’s house, uncovering cassette tapes, photos, and documents tied to past political activism. The attic becomes a metaphorical and literal space for hidden truths.
Gameplay is shaped by three main variables—trust, curiosity, and morality—which influence choices and determine the final outcome. I also incorporated conditionals using (if:) macros to ensure discovery has real consequences. For example, certain endings only unlock if the player restores the family photo or reads the hidden journal.
To meet technical requirements, I used over 10 unique macros: (set:) to manage state, (if:) and (else:) for conditional paths, (type:) for immersive text reveals, (audio:) for atmosphere, (transition:) and (replace:) for dynamic feedback, and (live:) to update elements in real-time. These enhance both mood and mechanics.
The ghost scene was key in raising emotional stakes. When all tapes are played, a spectral grandmother appears, whispering guidance. I used (audio:) to cue a haunting sound, and (replace:) with (live:) to simulate ghostly movement.
Ultimately, the player faces a final moral decision—hide, expose, or preserve the truth privately—reinforcing the game’s core theme: how we navigate inherited legacies.</p>
