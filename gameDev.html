     <h2>Context</h2>
<p>"Echo in the Attic" is an interactive, narrative-driven Twine game that blends mystery, memory, and social history to explore how silenced voices of the past shape our present understanding. The game follows a young protagonist who returns to their deceased grandmother’s house to settle her affairs. During this process, they uncover a complex history of civil rights activism, family secrets, and erased truths. As players progress discovering cassette tapes, unlocking hidden rooms, assembling photographs, and encountering a ghostly presence they piece together the story of a woman who bravely resisted injustice and the repercussions she and her sister faced for doing so. The game unfolds in a linear progression, encouraging players to experience each key location and narrative moment in a specific order. This design choice was intentional; rather than allowing free exploration from the start, I aimed to make the unfolding of truth feel earned and consequential. Everyroom, object, and decision reveal deeper layers not only about the grandmother’s past but also about the systemic forces that attempted to bury it. As the player's curiosity, trust, and morality statistics evolve, they are rewarded with emotional clarity and narrative closure. This culminates in one of several endings, including a special "Light" ending for those who uncover every truth. At its core, the game highlights societal issues such as historical erasure, the institutional silencing of Black activists (especially women), generational trauma, and the fragility of memory. Through audio, symbolism, and branching dialogue, the story reveals how easily legacies can be hidden or rewritten, particularly when they challenge dominant narratives. The tapes, ghost encounters, and found documents serve as metaphors for lost stories and resistance buried beneath decades of shame or fear.</p>
<p>The attic, as a recurring space of revelation, represents both the mind and history itself, a place where we store what we are not yet ready to face until it begins to haunt us. Creatively, I incorporated visual blur transitions to enhance the immersive experience. Each of these elements was chosen to reflect the themes of fading memory, blurred truth, and emotional unease. Additionally, the use of a stat-based system ($trust, $curiosity, $morality) reinforces the idea that emotional and ethical growth are integral to uncovering history; it's not just about finding facts but also about being willing to believe them. Through the process of creating Echoes of the Attic, I gained a deeper appreciation for how storytelling, especially interactive storytelling can serve as a tool for personal reflection and social critique. I learned how to blend narrative design with meaningful issues, guide player experience through programming, and respect the weight of the themes I explored. Ultimately, this project helped me understand that games can be more than mere entertainment; they can be vessels for memory, empathy, and change.</p>
